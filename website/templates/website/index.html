				<td id="presentation"> BraSCCH platform provides demographic, socioeconomic, maternal and child health indicators at the federal, state and municipal levels. The objective is to provide a management tool that allows both the maternal and child health situation and the context variables in which people are inserted to be known, allowing for the establishment of continuous follow-up processes (monitoring the implementation and evaluation of results). Our main proposal is to provide managers and society as a whole with useful data for the formulation of prevention policies and actions, as well as contributing to the improvement of the quality of health care and the information generated at the basic levels of care, with consequent reduction of neonatal mortality.</td>
